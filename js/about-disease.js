            overview: `<h4>What is Glaucoma?</h4>
                <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is vital for good vision. This damage is often caused by abnormally high pressure in your eye. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60.</p>
                <p>It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults. Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs, and the effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is at an advanced stage.</p>`,
            symptoms: `<h4>Common Symptoms</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patchy blind spots in your side (peripheral) or central vision, frequently in both eyes</li>
                    <li>Tunnel vision in the advanced stages</li>
                    <li>Severe headache</li>
                    <li>Eye pain</li>
                    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                    <li>Blurred vision</li>
                    <li>Halos around lights</li>
                    <li>Redness of the eye</li>
                </ul>`,
            causes: `<h4>What Causes Glaucoma?</h4>
                <p>Glaucoma is caused by damage to the optic nerve. As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your visual field. For reasons that doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.</p>
                <p>Elevated eye pressure is due to a buildup of a fluid (aqueous humor) that flows throughout the inside of your eye. This internal fluid normally drains out through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. When fluid is overproduced or the drainage system doesn't work properly, the fluid can't flow out at its normal rate and eye pressure increases.</p>`,
            treatment: `<h4>Treatment Options</h4>
                <p>Glaucoma damage is permanent â€” it cannot be reversed. But treatment and regular checkups can help slow or prevent vision loss, especially if the disease is caught in its early stages.</p>
                <p>Glaucoma is treated by lowering your eye pressure (intraocular pressure). Depending on your situation, your options may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eyedrops:</strong> These either reduce the production of fluid in your eye or increase its outflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral medications:</strong> If eyedrops alone don't bring your eye pressure down to the desired level, your doctor may also prescribe an oral medication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surgery and other therapies:</strong> These include laser therapy, filtering surgery, drainage tubes, or minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS).</li>
                </ul>`,
            prevention: `<h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
                <p>These steps may help detect and manage glaucoma in its early stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get regular comprehensive eye exams</li>
                    <li>Know your family's eye health history</li>
                    <li>Exercise safely</li>
                    <li>Take prescribed eyedrops regularly</li>

            overview: `<h4>What is Diabetic Retinopathy?</h4>
                <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).</p>
                <p>Initially, diabetic retinopathy might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. But it can lead to blindness if left untreated.</p>`,
            symptoms: `<h4>Common Symptoms</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)</li>

            causes: `<h4>What Causes Diabetic Retinopathy?</h4>
                <p>Over time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply. As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels. But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.</p>
                <p>There are two types of diabetic retinopathy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Early diabetic retinopathy (nonproliferative):</strong> In this more common form, new blood vessels aren't growing. Instead, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken and develop small bulges (microaneurysms), which may leak fluid and blood into the retina.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced diabetic retinopathy (proliferative):</strong> In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These can leak into the clear, jelly-like substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).</li>
                </ul>`,
            treatment: `<h4>Treatment Options</h4>
                <p>Treatment depends on the type and severity of your condition:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Early diabetic retinopathy:</strong> You might not need immediate treatment, but your eye doctor will closely monitor your eyes to determine when treatment should begin. Controlling blood sugar and blood pressure is important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced diabetic retinopathy:</strong> Options include focal laser treatment, scatter laser treatment (panretinal photocoagulation), vitrectomy, or injections of medications into the eye.</li>
                </ul>`,
            prevention: `<h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
                <p>You can reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managing diabetes through blood sugar control, blood pressure management, and cholesterol monitoring</li>

            overview: `<h4>What are Cataracts?</h4>
                <p>A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window.</p>
                <p>Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car (especially at night) or see the expression on a friend's face.</p>`,

            causes: `<h4>What Causes Cataracts?</h4>
                <p>Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some cataracts are related to inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems and increase your risk of cataracts.</p>

            treatment: `<h4>Treatment Options</h4>
                <p>Treatment of cataracts involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New eyeglasses:</strong> If a cataract is detected early, vision might be improved with new eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> If these measures don't help, surgery is the only effective treatment. Cataract surgery involves removing the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens. This is generally a safe, effective procedure.</li>

                    <li><strong>Fluid accumulates beneath the retina:</strong> Without a hole or tear, fluid can build up and separate the retina from the back of the eye. This is often caused by inflammatory diseases or injury.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scarring or shrinkage of the vitreous:</strong> This can pull the retina toward the center of the eye, causing it to detach.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Risk factors include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aging</li>
                    <li>Previous retinal detachment</li>
                    <li>Family history</li>
                    <li>Extreme nearsightedness</li>
                    <li>Previous eye surgery</li>
                    <li>Eye trauma</li>
                    <li>Certain eye disorders</li>
                </ul>`,
            treatment: `<h4>Treatment Options</h4>
                <p>Retinal detachment requires immediate medical attention. The type of surgery depends on the severity and location of the detachment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photocoagulation:</strong> Laser surgery to seal retinal tears or holes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryopexy:</strong> A freezing probe is used to seal the retina around tears or holes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scleral buckling:</strong> A flexible band is placed around the eye to counteract the force pulling the retina out of place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pneumatic retinopexy:</strong> A gas bubble is injected into the eye to push the retina back into place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitrectomy:</strong> Removal of the vitreous gel and replacement with a gas bubble or silicone oil.</li>
                </ul>`,
            prevention: `<h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
                <p>While not all retinal detachments can be prevented, these steps may help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular comprehensive dilated eye exams, especially if you have risk factors</li>
                    <li>Prompt attention to flashes, floaters, or vision changes</li>
                    <li>Eye protection to prevent trauma</li>
                    <li>Careful management of diabetes</li>
                    <li>Prompt treatment of retinal tears or holes</li>
